"""
Hi Guys, Joey here. If you see this that means you really want to see what's going on behind the scenes, please
The verification works similarily to your code in that it will create a dag and than compare your outputs generated
by your cpp file and ensure that compilation is in a topological order.

This is the Python Verification Code as part of the ECE 250 Testing Prject made by Joey Chen, Zefei Ou, and Xi'an Wang
